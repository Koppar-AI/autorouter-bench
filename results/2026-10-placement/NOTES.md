# Campaign 2026-10-placement

Every router got the placement only: tracks, vias and copper zones removed, keepout areas kept,
every net (ground included) left to the router; 1200 s per board, one workstation (24 cores,
one GPU), KiCad 10.0.4 as referee. Runs on 2026-10-14 and 2026-10-15; the Koppar rows, both
modes, on 2026-10-21, from one build; the Zap! rows on 2026-10-19, from its 2026.10.14.78 release.

- Freerouting 2.5.0, tscircuit 0.0.979, KiCad Routing Tools 0.1.9, TraceMaker 0.9.0 and Zap!
  were run with this repository's harness.
- Koppar is a hosted service; its boards were produced on the same machine, from the same
  fetched boards, and scored by the same collector. It was run in two modes, both reported:
  `koppar` keeps every via out of pin pads (the default; the board needs no special fab
  process), and `koppar_filled` lets vias sit in pin pads, for a board ordered with filled and
  capped vias (the extra-cost process the via-in-pad column refers to).
- The Koppar rows were re-run on 2026-10-21 (one run per board, as before). In this run the
  default mode left one connection open on imx8mp-som-evb, which was fully routed in the
  2026-10-16 Koppar run (in this file's history).
- Zap! (Mutual Solutions, hosted; service 2026.10.14.78, router r95cf716) was run with
  `harness/run.py zap`, one board at a time: `fab_floor=board`, `minutes=20` (its time is the
  job's run on the service, without queue, upload or download, so the whole cap is routing
  time), service defaults otherwise, polled to the end like Koppar. Every board came back inside
  the cap; on the five 4-layer carriers it stopped when its next attempt could not finish in
  time (`time_budget.stopped` = `time`). Job IDs are in `zap.json`.
- The first Zap! run (2026-10-14, service 2026.10.14.60, cancelled at the cap, no `minutes`)
  refused scalenode-cm4 (`footprints_outside_board`: footprint M1 lies off the outline in the
  human design; the new release routes it with a warning) and was cancelled at 1200 s on cm5io
  and imx8mp-som-evb. On the boards both runs finished, completion is the same or close
  (stmp157-som-evb 96.24% then, 95.58% now) and run times are longer now (pico-vga 17 s then,
  173 s now, where the job tried all 37 of its settings). That run is in this file's history.
- `finishedAtS`: when a tool reached the board it returned (Koppar: the first time the scored
  board's count was reached; Freerouting: its best-scoring pass; TraceMaker: its winning
  variant's end, an upper bound since a finished variant keeps cleaning up until the limit;
  tscircuit, KiCad Routing Tools and Zap!: their run time). `seconds`: how long the run took.
- A Koppar run that goes past the cap is scored on the last board it saved inside the cap; no
  run in these rows went past it. The service holds the route to the cap itself; the harness's
  cap + 600 s is how long it polls, not routing time. Koppar's `seconds` are measured by the
  client and include upload and queue (longest row 1126 s); Zap!'s are its run on the service.
  A Zap! board returned after the cap would be scored and marked late; none was.
- Vias in pin pads (SMD pads under 2 mm across, counted with `scripts/habits.py`): a via there
  needs a filled and capped via at the fab, and KiCad's DRC does not flag a via in its own
  net's pad. Koppar 0 on every board; Koppar (filled vias) 1 to 384; TraceMaker (its defaults)
  14 to 200 per board; KiCad Routing Tools 0 to 61; Freerouting, tscircuit and Zap! 0 to 1.
  `viasInPinPads` in each tool's results.
- Not scored: plane integrity. TraceMaker, Freerouting, tscircuit and KiCad Routing Tools pour
  no planes (ground is routed as tracks); Koppar and Zap! pour ground planes.

# PCBWorld-Bench, October 2026

Koppar on the PCBWorld-Bench real-board test sets, one attempt per board, measured
2026-10-18. Boards prepared with `pcbworld/prepare.py`, scored with `pcbworld/score.py`;
per-board results in `koppar.json`.

**Clean pass**: the routed board has every connection made and zero error-level
violations in KiCad's design-rule check, under the board's own rules (the PCBWorld guide
project). One missing connection scores zero. The score is the fraction of boards that pass.

Every row but Koppar's is copied as published by DeepPCB on 28 September 2026
([PCBWorld-Bench: DeepPCB results](https://deeppcb.ai/benchmark/pcbworld-bench-deeppcb-results/)),
whose baseline rows come from the PCBWorld paper
([arXiv 2607.05915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.05915v4)). We did not re-run any of them.
The paper also reports a best-of-five score with its own selection (D3-A 0.94, D3-B 0.78);
the table compares single attempts.

## How Koppar was run

- **Input**: each test board's guide board (`processed_v9_guide_v3`) with its tracks, vias and
  arcs removed, its copper pours and placement kept, and the guide project beside it, as
  PCBWorld's own pipeline loads it.
- **Router**: Koppar's route path with its 1200 s cap per board (no board came near it), one
  configuration for every board, run on the benchmark machine.
- **Machine**: one workstation (24 cores, one GPU). DeepPCB's times are from its own setup.

## Referee and differences from the paper's setup

- KiCad 10.0.4 (`kicad-cli pcb drc`, zones refilled, error severity, the guide project's
  rules). PCBWorld scores with its own KiCad 9.0.8 build. The preparation chain ran under
  KiCad 10 with two small patches (`pcbworld/patches/`): KiCad 10 writes net names where
  KiCad 9 wrote net numbers, and it adds a `pth_inside_courtyard` check, set to ignore like
  the other checks the chain ignores.
- Under KiCad 10 the reference boards themselves pass on 104 of 109: five guide boards keep a
  clearance finding the chain could not narrow away (0024, 0040, 0083, 0203, 0344). Koppar's
  routing passes on all five.

## What we do not claim

- Vias: Koppar placed 290 vias on D3-A and 140 on D3-B, against 117 and 67 on the reference
  boards (2.1 to 2.5 times). DeepPCB reports 0.59 and 0.50 times the reference on the nets
  without a pour. A clean pass does not score via count or track length.
- One run per board. The route is a timed search; a board can pass in one run and miss in another.
